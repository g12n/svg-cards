Heavily inspired by [Luke Pattons][Luke] project [Canvas Cards][Canvas cards] I set out to do something similar, but in SVG. 

## The Goal

52 Playing-Cards plus 3 Jokers. Created in Javascript. Ready to be printed. 

## Rules

Diving into Creative Coding can be overwealming because you can run into any direction, with no end and procratinate a lot by diving into every little aspect. So for this one I give myself a set of rules to stick to: 

- Create 55 Cards (A Poker Deck + 3 Jokers)
- One Card per week
- Dimensions for each Card: 5x8cm – given by 
- As much vanilla javascript as possible – with some belt by 11ty
- Be nice to yourself

##Notes

Order: ♦ Diamonds , Hearts ♥, Spades ♠, Clubs ♣
